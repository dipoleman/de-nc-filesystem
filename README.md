# NC Filesystem

We've all been in that situation where we don't know how best to organise our files. It's so easy to just save files all over the place and often with unhelpful names.

Such a fate has befallen the Northcoders central file system and it's your job to give it a good spring clean!

**If you need to reset the Northcoders filesystem at any time just run the** `./reset-filesystem` **script**

---

## **Section 1 - Checks and Reports**

Before we can start organising the Northcoders files there are some things we need to check.

It would also be helpful to create some reports about the filesystem for future use.

</br>

### **Task 1** - _Check if a staff file exists_

Within the very helpfully named `staff` directory there are a number of staff files. Your task is to create a script that checks if a file for a given staff ID number is present in the directory.

All staff files follow the same naming convention of `nc-ID.json` for example the file `nc-001.json`.

Your script should print out a suitable message to the terminal indicating if the staff file can be found.

While you could hard-code the ID of the staff member that you wish to search for within the script it would be nicer (and much more reusable) if you could pass an ID number to the script. For example:

```sh
$ ./section-1/check-staff-file-exists "001"
# prints "Staff file found" to the terminal
```
<em>**Hint**: Have a look at CHMOD if you are having permission issues</em>....

</br>

### **Task 2** - _Check file type_

The `code` directory is absolutely jam-packed, to help us sift through the contents you should create a script that prompts the user for a name of a file/directory and reports on whether it is a file or a directory.

If it is a directory you should also list the contents of said directory.

Example use:

```sh
$ ./section-1/2-check-file-type

...

# If user inputs "be-pets-and-owners" something like this shoult be printed to the terminal:

be-pets-and-owners is a directory

Contents of be-pets-and-owners:

README.md
```

</br>

### **Task 3** - _Find cat pictures_

Over the years Northcoders has gathered a wonderful selection of cat pictures. However they are saved all over the place and are not named in a helpful manner.

Having said that these cat pictures are the only `jpeg` files in our file system which could be useful when locating them!

Your job is to create a `cat-pics.txt` file within the `/section-1/reports` directory that lists the file paths to each cat picture. For example:

```txt
> /section-1/reports/cat-pics.txt

./nc-filesystem/stuff/1.jpeg
etc...
etc...
```

> ‚ùó Make sure you only store the information about files contained within the `nc-filesystem`, **_not_** the nc-filesystem-backup!

The [find](https://manned.org/find) command (and some of it's associated options) could come in very handy here!

</br>



## **Section 2 - Cleaning up the filesystem**

Now we've run a few checks on the filesystem and created a few reports it's time for a good old ‚ú®*spring clean*‚ú®. Let's sort out the mess.

</br>

### **Task 1** - _Delete empty files_

First things first you may or may not have noticed that there are a number of empty files.

Your task is to create a script that finds these empty files and deletes them.

There are a number of ways you could check if a file is empty. A good option could be using the [wc](https://manned.org/wc.1) command.

> ‚ùó Keep in mind that the `rm` command will **permanently remove files/directories** (not just move them to the bin) so should be used with care. We can recommend [this](https://github.com/sindresorhus/trash-cli) tool which makes removing files safer and reversible. You can read more about how not to "`rm` yourself" [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/main/how-not-to-rm-yourself.md#safeguard-rm)

</br>

### **Task 2** - _Move the cats_

Remember how you created a list of cat picture file paths? It's now time to use that information!

Create a script that uses the data in `/section-1/reports/cat-pics.txt` (created in section 1, task 2) and moves the files into a `cat-pics` directory.

Additionally you should also rename the file to be clearer what it is. For example: `cat1.jpeg` instead of `1.jpeg`

</br>

### **Task 3** - _Rename incorrectly named files_

In the `code` directory you'll notice that some files and directories start with `fun-`/`be-`/`de-`. However only the **directories** should have this naming convention.

Your job is to create a script that removes the `fun-`/`be-`/`de-` prefix from **files** but leave the **directories** untouched.

> You could refactor your `2-check-file-type` script to accept a command line argument instead of user input and then use that script to check the contents on the `code` directory. However this is by no means the only way to approach this task.

</br>

### **Task 4** - _Organise code_

Now for the biggest task, it's time to organise the code.

If you have a look at the `code` directory you'll see that there are a range of files containing code written in several different programming languages.

</br>

**Within the code directory you should end up with a structure like this:**

```txt
/code
  /javascript
    /sprints
    /katas
    /loose
  /python
    /sprints
    /katas
    /loose
  /go
    /katas
    /loose
  /typescript
    /katas
    /loose
```

Your task is to organise by the following rules:

- **Directories** that start with `fun` or `be` can be moved into the `javascript/sprints` directory.
- **Directories** that start with `de` can be moved into the `python/sprints` directory.
- **Files** that start with `kata-` can be moved into a `kata` directory depending on what file extension they have (`js` / `py` / `go` / `ts`).
- Any other files that aren't covered by the previous rules can be moved into a `loose` directory depending on their file extension.

Well done on completing the scripting exercises! You now have a choice, you can continue with some harder tasks on our file system (**_Harder Tasks_**) or try your hand at creating your own custom scripts (**_Extension Tasks_**)

## Harder Tasks



### **Task 1** - _Filter staff by known programming languages_

The number of mentors at Northcoders has grown a lot recently and we need a way to find out who should be assigned where.

Your job is to create a script that accepts a programming language as it's sole argument and creates a `txt` file that lists the mentors that know that language.

For example:

```sh
$ ./section-1/4-filter-mentors-by-language "Python"

...

# This should create a file called "python-mentors.txt" in the reports directory which contains the names of all the mentors that know python
```

> ‚ùó Not all staff members are **mentors**, make sure you only list the names of mentors who know the given programming language.

As the staff files are is `json` format you might wish to use a tool like [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

## Extension tasks

Congratulations üéâ. You have successfully sorted out our file system, look how tidy it is now!

Here's some ideas for unrelated scripts you can create to flex your new found shell-scripting skills.

1. Create a script that when run displays a digital clock in your terminal.

> It's one thing to display the time in a nice readable way but can you make it so the clock refreshes every second?

</br>

2. If there's a sequence of commands to use regularly see if you can automate it.

> A good choice might be something like `git clone` and `npm install` which you will have done a lot of in the Fundamentals and Backend sections of the course.

</br>

3. Create a terminal based note taking tool/cheatsheet.

You should be able to:

- write notes
- edit notes
- read notes

> Think about how this could be organised. A simple `txt` file? A `json` file? Should the notes be organised by topic?
